# CET (Civil Engineering Tools)
This is a python code that makes calculation of some of most common civil engineering problems.
It is still under development, so there is only one function that this code is capable of (for now). \
I'm planning to add some other functions, even languages as well.

# Usage
Just launch the code and it will tell you which variables you should pass to the program.
